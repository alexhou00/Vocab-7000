# Vocab-7000
 
This Python script uses Tkinter to create a vocabulary learning system for high school English learners. It provides an interactive way for students to improve their English vocabulary skills based on the Taiwanese high school curriculum, with the most basic must-learn 7000 vocabularies.

## Features
### Question Types
* (not finished) <br>
The system allows for the configuration of different question types, presumably to practice different aspects of vocabulary knowledge (e.g., definition, usage, etc.)

### Level System
There's a level system based on GSAT, the college entrance exam in Taiwan, allowing for progressive learning, where users can practice vocabulary at different difficulty levels.

### Question Review
Users can review their answers, and it also includes options to mark words that the user finds difficult. (not finished)

### External Resources Integration
The script includes options to open external resources, such as Google Translate and etymology lookup, presumably to assist in learning.

### User interface
The interface includes a panel for reviewing past answers and a control panel for configuring the practice session.

## Running the Script
Ensure that Python and Tkinter are installed on your system.
If not, you can use the .exe file
Run the script using Python (python Vocab-7000.py).
A window will pop up asking you to choose a database (some of them aren't finished), select an option, and click confirm.
The main window will open with various functionalities.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the script, fix bugs, or enhance its features are always welcome. <br>
